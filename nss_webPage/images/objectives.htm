          NSS Logo: <br />
          The logo for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the
          world famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Orissa,
          India. The Red & Blue colors contained in the logo motivate the NSS
          Volunteers to be active & energetic for the nation-building social
          activities. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and
          release and signifies the movement in life across time and space, The
          wheel thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the
          continuous striving of NSS for social change.
          <br />
